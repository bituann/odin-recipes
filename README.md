# odin-recipes

This is my first project on TheOdinProject. Though I have a background in web development already, I'm still excited to do this. I hope to display my basic HTML skills by designing a basic recipes page. This will allow me demonstrate my use of:

- Elements and Tags
- Links
- Lists
- Images

Let's do this!
